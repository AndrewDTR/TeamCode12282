# FTC PowerPlay 22-23
## Team Code


For the team: hey, welcome to this repo! This is simply a place where we're going to keep the team code for the FTC *(First Tech Challenge)* 2022-2023 PowerPlay competition. There are a lot of folders and structures in this repository, with the majority of them being external dependencies used for building the app and controlling the robot. The code that we write can be found in `master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode`.

To contribute code to this repository, you will have to isuse a **pull request**, that is, making a request that the code you write will be **pulled** into the main branch. GitHub offers a starting point [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) that can give you a working knowledge of version control systems.

For everyone else: hi! We've decided to release our code this year in the hopes that perhaps other teams will be able to get some value from it. Hopefully the inner workings of our code can offer some inspiration!
